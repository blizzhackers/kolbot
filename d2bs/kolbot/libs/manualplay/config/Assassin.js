// Assassin config file

/* Brief instructions:
 * Use any IDE to modify these files, Visual Studio Code (recommended), Atom, Sublime Text 3 (good), NotePad++ (not recommended)
 * 
 * Basic JS Rules:
 * To comment out something, put // in front of that line
 * !!!Never comment out something you're not sure about, set it to false or disable as noted in description if you don't want to use it.
 * true and false are case sensitive. Good: Config.SomeVar = true; Bad: Config.SomeVar = True;
 * Arrayname = [1, 0, 1] is an array. Elements in an Array need commas seperatings them
 * Array Example: Good: Config.QuitList = ["sorcCharname", "bobarbCharname"]; Bad: Config.QuitList = ["sorcCharname" "bobarbCharname"];
 * Types: "sorcCharname" is an example of a string. String elements need " " around them.
 * Continuing with QuitList this is Bad: Config.QuitList = [sorcCharname, bobarbCharname];
 * Javascript statements need to end with a semi-colon; Good: Scripts.Corpsefire = false; Bad: Scripts.Corpsefire = false
